# Python Practice — Practical Fluency

Generate Python exercises that build practical language fluency first, then apply
it to backends, CLIs, automation, AWS workflows, testing, and production-style
projects.

The center of gravity is **becoming fluent enough to build useful things in
Python**. FastAPI, Flask, and AWS automation are preferred application tracks,
not the whole curriculum.

Each normal practice request produces **3 exercises** as separate `.py` files or
small Python packages, depending on topic. Use the root learning log to choose
useful practice, but do not run a progress tracker or maintain a hidden progress
database.

All user exercise work lives in this fixed repo:

```text
/home/laborant/repos/python-practice
```

Do not create Python practice exercises elsewhere unless the user explicitly
gives a different path.

## When To Use

- User wants Python practice, exercises, challenges, code review, or debugging.
- User asks about functions, classes, typing, pytest, files, JSON, HTTP, CLIs,
  APIs, FastAPI, Flask, boto3, AWS automation, backend work, or scripts.
- User asks for backend Python learning, automation skill, AWS scripting, or
  open-source Python contribution prep.
- User says "I'm stuck", "review my solution", "make it harder/easier", or asks
  clarifying questions while solving Python exercises.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Ask For Topic If Missing

If the user did not specify a topic, offer this menu:

```text
Which Python area do you want to practice?

1. Foundations       — syntax, functions, data structures, files, exceptions
2. OOP + Design      — classes, dataclasses, protocols, composition, package boundaries
3. Standard Library  — pathlib, json, csv, datetime, collections, itertools, logging, argparse
4. Testing + Quality — pytest, fixtures, mocks, typing, lint-friendly design
5. Backend Python    — HTTP, FastAPI, Flask, validation, middleware, service boundaries
6. Automation + AWS  — boto3-shaped clients, retries, pagination, IAM-safe scripts, CLIs
7. Data + Utilities  — pandas-style data handling, CSV/JSON transforms, reporting scripts

Pick one, or name a specific thing like "FastAPI dependencies" or "boto3 pagination".
```

Skip this step when the user names a topic directly.

### Step 2: Choose Learning Mode

If the user does not specify a mode, use `batch`.

Modes:
- `batch`: 3 exercises. Default for steady practice.
- `drill`: 1 small focused task for one concept or repeated mistake.
- `debug`: broken production-ish code plus tests.
- `applied`: realistic backend, CLI, AWS, or automation task.
- `pr-simulation`: read a small existing package, patch a bug, explain tradeoffs.
- `design-review`: choose package boundaries, types, dependencies, and error
  behavior before coding.
- `capstone`: multi-step project from the capstone ladder.

Use the mode to control scope. Do not force 3 exercises when the user asks for a
small drill, review, or project-style task.

### Step 3: Prepare Practice Workspace

Use `/home/laborant/repos/python-practice` as the exercise repo.

If it does not exist, create it as a git repo with:
- `README.md`
- `learning-log.md`
- `.gitignore`

When creating exercises, put them in a date folder under that repo. Folder names
use this format:

```text
D-mmm-YY
```

Examples:
- `3-may-26`
- `30-apr-26`
- `12-jun-26`

Use lowercase English month abbreviations: `jan`, `feb`, `mar`, `apr`, `may`,
`jun`, `jul`, `aug`, `sep`, `oct`, `nov`, `dec`.

Rules:
- On a new day, create that day's folder.
- If the user asks for more exercises on the same day, add more exercises to the
  same folder.
- Number new exercises after existing ones in that folder.
- Keep the root `learning-log.md` as durable memory across days.
- Read earlier date folders when useful, especially when the log references them.
- Commit exercise additions in the `python-practice` repo unless the user asks not to.

### Step 4: Read Learning Context

Open `/home/laborant/repos/python-practice/learning-log.md` if it exists;
otherwise copy the starter shape from `references/learning-log.md`.

Scan:
- Recurring mistakes
- Clarifying questions the user keeps asking
- Concepts already comfortable
- Domain goals and current focus
- Last exercise batch
- Prior dated exercise folders

Do not use `scripts/progress_tracker.py`, `progress.json`, or any hidden scoring
system. Update the learning log directly after reviews and after important
clarifying questions.

### Step 5: Choose Difficulty And Domain

Use `references/topic-catalog.md`.
Use `references/practice-tracks.md` when the user wants backend, FastAPI, Flask,
AWS automation, CLI/tooling, data utility, or capstone direction.

Default progression:
- Level 1: core language and small single-file tasks
- Level 2: functions, modules, tests, exceptions, typing, and standard library
- Level 3: realistic scripts, CLIs, backend handlers, AWS automation boundaries
- Level 4: project-style tasks using FastAPI, Flask, AWS automation, or packages

Adjust from the learning log:
- Repeated syntax/type confusion -> lower level, isolate concept.
- Repeated "why this abstraction?" questions -> include design-review or package-boundary task.
- Repeated testing confusion -> include pytest fixture/mock drill.
- Strong fundamentals -> shift toward backend, automation, AWS, and project-style exercises.
- User asks for challenge -> use Level 3 or 4 with tests and realistic constraints.

### Step 6: Generate Exercises

Read `references/exercise-templates.md` before creating files.

Default batch:
- 1 completion exercise
- 1 debugging exercise
- 1 applied backend/automation/framework exercise with tests

Adapt batch mix:
- If user struggles with bugs -> 2 debugging exercises.
- If user asks many clarifying questions -> 1 concept drill, 1 guided completion, 1 applied task.
- If user is advanced -> 3 applied tasks across backend, AWS automation, testing, and utilities.

Mode-specific output:
- `drill`: 1 file plus test.
- `debug`: 1 broken file plus test, or 3 bugs in one focused package.
- `applied`: 1 small module/package with README and tests.
- `pr-simulation`: 1 small existing-style package with failing test and review prompt.
- `design-review`: markdown prompt plus skeleton package only if useful.
- `capstone`: module with README, phased tests, and learning-log checkpoint.

File naming:

```text
NN_<topic>_<subtopic>_<type>.py
NN_<topic>_<subtopic>_<type>_test.py
```

Start `NN` from `01` in each date folder. If the date folder already has
exercises, continue from the highest existing number.

For package-level exercises, create:

```text
<date-folder>/NN_<topic>_<subtopic>/
  README.md
  pyproject.toml
  src/<package_name>/...
  tests/...
```

Every exercise should include:
- Short header comment/docstring with topic, level, domain, and source inspiration.
- Clear goal.
- `TODO` markers for completion tasks or intentionally broken code for debug tasks.
- Tests that initially fail.
- Realistic backend/AWS/framework framing when useful.
- No hidden answer in comments.

Prefer standard library first. Use FastAPI, Flask, boto3, pandas, or other
libraries only when the exercise specifically needs them; otherwise simulate
boundaries with small functions or protocols to keep setup light.

### Step 7: Verify Exercises Fail Correctly

Run from the date folder or specific package folder:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

For single-file exercises with inline tests, run:

```bash
python <exercise_file.py>
```

Expected: generated exercises should fail because the user has work to do. If
any exercise passes before the user edits it, make the missing work explicit and
re-run.

Prefer pytest for backend, AWS automation, and framework work because production
Python benefits from repeatable tests.

### Step 8: Deliver To User

Use this structure:

```text
Created <count> Python exercise(s) on <topic> at Level <N>.

Focus:
- <why these exercises were selected from learning-log.md>

Files:
- <path> — <one-line task>
- <path> — <one-line task>
- <path> — <one-line task>

Run: cd /home/laborant/repos/python-practice/<date-folder> && python -m pytest
Send me your solution when ready.
```

### Step 9: Review User Solutions

When user asks for review:
- Run formatting/linting only if configured in the exercise. Do not invent a new toolchain.
- Run `python -m pytest`.
- For single-file exercises, run `python <exercise_file.py>` if that is the exercise contract.
- Read `references/review-guide.md`.
- Review correctness first, then idiomatic Python, then backend/AWS/framework production concerns.

Review should call out:
- Passing/failing tests
- Bugs or edge cases
- Idiomatic Python improvements
- Type hints and API boundaries
- Error handling
- Test quality
- Backend/framework/AWS production relevance when applicable

### Step 10: Update Learning Log

After each review, update `/home/laborant/repos/python-practice/learning-log.md`
manually.

Record:
- Date folder
- Exercises completed
- Mistakes observed
- Clarifying questions asked
- Concepts now stronger
- Concepts still weak
- Suggested next batch

Mistake examples:
- `mutable-default-arg`
- `missing-return`
- `type-confusion`
- `exception-swallowed`
- `path-string-not-pathlib`
- `mock-too-broad`
- `fixture-scope-confusion`
- `fastapi-dependency-confusion`
- `flask-global-state`
- `boto3-pagination-missing`
- `aws-retry-missing`
- `iam-action-too-broad`
- `not-pythonic-loop`

Clarifying question examples:
- "When should I use a dataclass?"
- "When do I mock versus use a fake?"
- "Why use pathlib here?"
- "Where should validation live in FastAPI?"
- "When should I use Flask blueprints?"
- "How do I handle boto3 pagination?"
- "What makes this script safe to rerun?"

If the same clarifying question category appears twice, the next batch must
include a contrast exercise that forces the distinction.

### Step 11: Interactive Help

- "I'm stuck" -> Give a hint, not the solution. Tie hint to prior mistakes.
- "Explain this concept" -> Explain with a small Python example and one practical use case.
- "Why this exercise?" -> Point to learning-log patterns and target domain.
- "Make it harder" -> Add tests for edge cases, failure paths, validation, idempotency, or mocks.
- "Make it easier" -> Reduce to one concept and remove external dependencies.
- "Review this like backend Python" -> Emphasize boundaries, validation, error handling, tests, and API shape.
- "Prepare me for AWS automation" -> Use boto3-shaped clients, pagination, retries, idempotency, and dry-run patterns.
- "Help me build anything in Python" -> Rotate through foundations, packages, tests, CLIs, backend, automation, and applied projects.

## Capstone Ladder

Offer capstones when the user wants project-style practice or has completed
several batches successfully.

1. `python-toolbox`: file, JSON, CSV, pathlib, argparse, logging, and tests.
2. `automation-runner`: idempotent scripts, dry-run behavior, retries, and reports.
3. `flask-service`: small Flask API with blueprints, validation, tests, and app factory.
4. `fastapi-service`: FastAPI app with dependencies, Pydantic models, routers, and tests.
5. `aws-inventory-tool`: boto3-shaped collectors with pagination, retries, filtering, and dry-run planning.
6. `backend-worker`: queue-shaped worker with retries, structured errors, and persistence boundary.

Keep capstones small enough to finish incrementally. Each phase should have tests
and a learning-log checkpoint.

## Open Source Readiness

When the learning log shows repeated success with:
- Functions, data structures, and exceptions
- OOP and package boundaries
- Type hints and protocols
- pytest fixtures and mocks
- Backend validation and error handling
- AWS automation safety patterns
- Idiomatic Python style

Suggest reading and modifying small issues in Python open-source repositories.
Start with docs/tests/internal utilities before touching core runtime paths.
